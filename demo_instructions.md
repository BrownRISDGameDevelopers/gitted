- Clone this repo
- Open repo locally, make new file in repo.
- Add some contents to local file and save.
- `git add *`
- `git commit -m "first commit"`
- `git push`
- Open this repo on GitHub, edit the file in web and commit changes (this is equivalent to someone else editing locally and pushing)
- In local, make some other changes to the same line of the file.
- `git add *`
- `git commit -m "this will cause a conflict"`
- `git pull`: This should give a merge conflict
- Check the merge conflict file using `git status`
